## Project-Team-13

A cluster index is a structure that sorts and stores the entries in the table and expedite the process of data retrieval in table and views. Indexing is now one of the vital components in the data retrieval process lifecycle.

In our project, A real time MySQL database performance enhancer where we observed various complex queries which were performed. All the complex queries were logged and parsed later. We gave weight to the operations performed based on the complexity and resources required by them. At the end of parsing, we find the best suitable column which is to be considered for indexing.
 
After deciding on the columns, we perform indexing operation on the MySQL database to further enhance the performance of data retrieval.
